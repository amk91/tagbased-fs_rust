## File type-specific metadata
#### Note 1
> A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the systemâ€™s contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. **Automatic indexing is performed when files or directories are created or updated.**
